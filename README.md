# CS 441 Final Project – Machine Learning Models

This repository contains the code for our CS 441 Final Project (Fall 2025).

## Project Overview
We explore a machine learning application that predicts short-term stock
price movement using self-collected news headlines.

## Code Structure
Each notebook corresponds to a different model:



## Environment
The notebooks were developed and run in Google Colab.

Main libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- pytorch (for neural models)

## How to Run
Open any notebook and run all cells from top to bottom.
Paths assume data is loaded from the data repository.
